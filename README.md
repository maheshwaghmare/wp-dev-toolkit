# WP Dev Toolkit

Collection of reusable and optimized WordPress APIs.

While developing WordPress themes and plugins we repeat lot of code.

So, To avoid the reputation I have separate the code with different APIs to perform different auctions.

We can use them according our development requirement.

Below is the list of existing APIs.

| Context | API | Description |
--------|---------|----
| Remote Post/Get | [WP Dev Remote API](https://maheshwaghmare/wp-dev-remote-request) | Perform the WP remote get and post request thought rest API with cache support. |
| Text Content | [WP Dev Table of Content](https://github.com/maheshwaghmare/wp-dev-table-of-content) | Generate the table of content from given content. |
| Meta Field's | [WP Meta Fields](https://github.com/maheshwaghmare/wp-meta-fields) | Generate the meta field's for post, pages custom post type etc. |
